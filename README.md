# Blockchain Visualizer 🌐

Welcome to the Blockchain Visualizer project! This project is a practice endeavor inspired by the fantastic work of [Anders Brownworth's Blockchain](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain). I'm diving into the fascinating world of blockchain to understand its inner workings better!

## Overview ℹ️

This project is a visual representation of a blockchain system, aiming to make the complex concepts behind blockchain technology more accessible and fun! It follows the proof of work consensus mechanism, just like Bitcoin, so you know it's legit! 💪

## Features 🚀

- **User Interface:** Intuitive user interface designed for ease of use. I didn't care much about making it look modern; I just wanted it to be as user-friendly as possible! 🎨
- **Chain Visualization:** Visual representation of the blockchain with real-time updates as blocks are mined. It's like watching your digital money grow!😉
- **Proof of Work:** Experience the thrill of mining blocks with the proof of work mechanism. Get ready to flex those computational muscles! 💻⛏️

## Roadmap 🛣️

Here's what's coming up next:

- **Coinbase Implementation:** Coming soon to a blockchain near you! Keep your eyes peeled for updates! 👀
