## Overview ℹ️

Blockchain Visualizer is a practice endeavor project inspired by the fantastic work of [Anders Brownworth's Blockchain](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain). We're diving into the fascinating world of blockchain to understand its inner workings better!

## Features 🚀

- **User Interface:** Intuitive user interface designed for ease of use. I didn't care much about making it look modern; I just wanted it to be as user-friendly as possible! 🎨
- **Chain Visualization:** Visual representation of the blockchain with real-time updates as blocks are mined. It's like watching your digital money grow!😉
- **Proof of Work:** Experience the thrill of mining blocks with the proof of work mechanism. Get ready to flex those computational muscles! 💻⛏️

## Roadmap 🛣️

Here's what's coming up next:

- **Coinbase Implementation:** Coming soon to a blockchain near you! Keep your eyes peeled for updates! 👀


## Optional Configuration 🛠️

Feeling adventurous? Dive into the heart of mining and tweak the `Difficulty` variable in the `BlockHashUtility.cs` class. But beware! Increasing the difficulty might turn your computer into a reluctant marathon runner 🏃‍♂️. So, if you like challenges (and your PC's peace of mind), go ahead and tweak away!

## Contributing 🎉

Yay, you're interested in contributing! That's awesome! If you've got some brilliant ideas bubbling up in your brain or just want to fix a typo, please follow the standard GitHub flow: fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work, and I'm more than open to your contributions!
